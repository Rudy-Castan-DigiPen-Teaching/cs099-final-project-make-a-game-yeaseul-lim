# Game Design Document
## High Concept
    Players fight in space to save the Earth, which is in danger because of the monster that stole fire, water, and light. When the player collects all the stars, the player meets the monster. If the player wins the monster, he moves on to the next stage. Players should be careful not to touch traps, planets, bombs and particles in the process of collecting stars and fighting monsters. The player shoots a gun.

## Theme
    Theme : shooting game 
<br>

    Because the space is the background, there are many images related to the space that users can see. Players must collect a certain number of stars to meet monsters. There is a planet in the process of collecting stars. 
    
    When a planet collides with a player, the player's HP is reduced. Planets explode over time. When the planet explodes, particles are created. When a particle and a player collide, the player's HP is reduced.When a player's bullet collides with a planet, the planet's HP is reduced. As the HP of the planet decreases, fewer particles are produced when the planet explodes in proportion to its decrease. When a particle and a player's shot collide, the collision particles and bullets disappear. 
    
    When player collect all the stars, monsters come out. Each stage has different properties of the monster. Water bombs and water traps come out when fighting the monster that stole the water. Fire bombs and fire trap come out when fighting the monster that stole the fire, and light bombs and light trap come out when fighting the monster that stole the light. 
    
    Each bomb explodes and creates a particle. When a player collides with a particle of a bomb, the player's HP is reduced. Only when a player's shot hits the monster's head does the monster's HP decrease. Players also lose HP when they collide with the monster's head. So if the monster's legs collide with the player, the player's HP will not decrease.

    If the player's HP is zero, it will be game over, and if the monster's HP is zero, it will be able to move on to the next stage or see the ending screen.

    Each stage has an item. It can be used only when items are collected. Item usage time can be seen at the bottom of the screen. Using defensive items changes the player's image to that of a defensive ball, and the player's HP does not decrease no matter what the player collides with. If player use jet items, the image of the player changes to that of the jet, and if player shoot a gun, five bullets are fired at once, but the number of bullets the player has is reduced by one. 
    
    There are 50 initial bullets and zero bullets do not fire. Eating bullets charges 50 bullets.
